title: Publishing logseq notes with github pages on windows
---

- How to publish your [[logseq]] notes via [[Github]] from [[Windows]].
	 - Works on computers where you don't have administrative access.

	 - If you are using a file sharing app on your computer like [[OneDrive]] or [[Google Drive]], go ahead and create an empty sub-folder called 'logseq' or whatever you wish to store a copy of your logseq notes.

	 - (optional) Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is optional, but I prefer it over notepad/wordpad for editing plain text files. You'll have to do one minor edit to a configuration file later.

	 - Signup for an account on [Github](https://github.com/). This is where you'll store your logseq files online and publish them to the web via github pages.

	 - Download and install the [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)

	 - Create a new github repository - call it 'Notes' or whatever you wish.

	 - Download and install the [Logseq Desktop App](https://logseq.com/)

	 - TODO (notes incomplete) - also, with this solution you have to manually sync your notes with github rather than auto-syncing. Another recommended tool for auto-syncing (SparkleShare) required admin rights to install.
