	- >“Listening theater” is when a manager appears to be seeking out feedback from their staff, but none of that feedback is ever taken seriously or used. #quote
	- >Employee [[voice]] (an employee’s willingness to speak up about things) has been shown to be a critical element of successful [[workplace]] functioning in study after study.
	- >The manager may actually care about the points of view of their staff, but not more than their need to be in control
	- >A good manager can’t white-knuckle the work; they have to trust in and empower their staff.
	- >We’ve got to let go of the idea of manager as “boss.”
	- >Before asking for feedback, consider why you want to do that and how you plan to use what you learn. If you don’t have any plan for actually using the feedback, don’t ask for it. There is nothing worse than taking the time to thoughtfully provide feedback on something only to be completely ignored.
	- >A manager who is really concerned with diversity, equity, and inclusion knows that making progress on this work requires empowering and giving voice to those with the least power in the organization. But in places with fearful or autocratic management, you sometimes see the (often White) people at the top running DEI work and deciding how that learning and engagement will trickle down to the (often more diverse) staff, some of whom may actually even have experience with this sort of work in other settings.
	- >“Listening theater” feels like gaslighting. In the moment, you might really feel like you’re being heard, but when your manager never takes action on anything you’ve discussed, you begin to feel like a ghost — like you’re talking to someone who literally doesn’t see or hear you. You question yourself — are your suggestions terrible? Really stupid? Is your manager just humoring you in the moment? Maybe there’s something wrong with you. You start to feel too embarrassed to bring things up (because clearly your ideas are truly awful).

	- >Pretending to answer them under a veil of [[objectivity]] serves to dehumanize our colleagues
	- >In the 1972 book [[Social Science]]s as Sorcery, Stanislav Andreski argued that, in their search for [[objectivity]], researchers had settled for a cheap version of it, hiding behind statistical methods as “quantitative camouflage.” Instead, we should strive for the moral objectivity we need to simultaneously live in the world and study it. #quote
